        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Salem Oregon but have lived most my life in Aumsville. I have also lived in Arizona and Minnesota but that was mainly for work. I have five siblings, one sister and four brothers. I graduated highschool at <em>Cascade high school</em> which is where I first started programming. Through my short 20 years, I have done many different kinds of jobs including <span class="highlight"> catering, tiling, renovating, house building, gardening, etc.</span> Now my focus is to add computer programming to my resume because as a child it was something I was always facinated by. My hobbies include <strong>basketball, acting, music and traveling.</strong></p>
